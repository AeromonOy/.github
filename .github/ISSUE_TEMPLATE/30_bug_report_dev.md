3. Please also test the steps yourself, if possible.

* Requirements must be clear and unambiguous, and usually objectively evaluable.
* In particular, **DO NOT** just duplicate "Observed behavior" here.
* Good examples:
    * Current behavior must be available with a flag (for XYZ reason)
    * Migration created to update incorrect data caused by this
