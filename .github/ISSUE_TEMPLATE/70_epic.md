### Description

Write a description of the feature or process.

Typically, this includes:

* The target audience for the feature.
* The problem the feature is trying to solve.
* An overall description of the functionality of the feature. Avoid repeating contents of sections.

### Requirements

* Write requirements for the overall feature.
* In the epic description, keep these relevant to the feature at large. Put subfeature requirements in their dedicated issues.
* Requirements must be clear and unambiguous.
* Requirements should be objectively evaluable.

### Tasks

* Create bullet points for tasks.
* Create issues as soon as planning converges and link them here like:
* #12345
* AeromonOy/repo-name#123
* Make the tasks concise - more than 1-2 sentences should go in the issue body and not the list.
    * If multiple nontrivial subtasks can be intuitively grouped into one issue, make them indented bullet points under the issue.
    * These nested items are not for explanation either, keep them for listing the subtasks of the issue.
    * When the issue title is well-written, just `#123` suffices - GitHub will expand the title in its place.
